# A preliminary study on the equivalence between deterministic and probabilistic methods

Abstract

This study explores the equivalence between deterministic and probabilistic methods in the context of chess artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on two AI models: Kane and Abel. Kane represents the deterministic approach, while Abel embodies the probabilistic methodology. Leveraging Avi Wigderson's theories on computational complexity, randomization, and derandomization, we examine the conditions under which these two seemingly distinct methods converge. We apply Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to analyze the equivalence, providing symbolic representations that illustrate the underlying functional similarities between deterministic and probabilistic algorithms. Through a series of experiments, including heuristic adjustments and transformations, we demonstrate that with increasing iterations, both methods can achieve similar outcomes, validated by convergence in equivalence score curves and algorithmic equilibrium. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of AI development, particularly in optimizing decision-making processes in complex environments like chess. Future research will delve deeper into the structural aspects of equivalence, symmetry applications, further enhancing the theoretical and practical implications of this study.
